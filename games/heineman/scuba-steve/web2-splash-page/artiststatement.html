				<p>Our research began with the game called "Mass Effect". The reason we chose this game and decided to work together was because of our overall draw towards morality based games, which is exactly what "Mass Effect" is based around. After researching what type of game we wanted, we then needed to figure out what we wanted our game to look like, style wise. While deciding this, we also had to search what type of framework we wanted to use. We combined these two steps by first researching games using the given options of frameworks that we could use. This process helped us settle on using the Impact.js framework to create our 2D Side Scroller.
				</p> 
				<p>Our initial goal with "Scuba Steve" was to have this underlying plot or storyline that introduced how the main player appeared in the situation that he did. This storyline was to also help define what Scuba Steve's purpose was and what the end goal was. To convey this storyline and plot with the player, we wanted to create this large dialogue scene within the intro of the game to give the player a backstory. Once the player moved through the initial cut-scene, the player would then play the first level with the ability to interact with other characters to further the plot. We also wanted to incorporate a "relic" collectible to give the player a tangible goal for the game rather than just the story line.   
				</p>
				<p>As we progressed with our game, we realized that much of what we wanted to do either could not be managed, or there just was not enough time. As of now there is no visible storyline, morality based decisions, or any collectible relics. These are all things we would like to include in the game as we continue to improve it. The game you will be able to play and watch us play is simply a 2D side-scroller game with amazing visuals.
